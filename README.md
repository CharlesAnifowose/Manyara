#Manyara

### Build textbooks better, together.

This project is an attempt to replicate the energy of Github which has allowed coders to get, build, share, and grow code like never before. 

Github has been great for several reasons:
- Newbies get great code to play with
- Seasoned coders have a place to keep their work and show it off
- Teams have a place to collaborate

The academic community has no shortage of journals for publishing new research and thinking. Manyara is a new option for ground-level knowledge. Although some may choose to ditch the prestige and remuneration that comes with an established academic journal, we are really doing this for those fundamental topics which thousands of teachers teach and millions of students learn.

What kind of textbook can a group of indie teachers put together by simply taking a base and tweaking it to their own liking? I hope that it proves useful to some and works as a good platform for teachers and learners alike.
